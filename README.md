# Forecasting
[reference](https://otexts.com/fpp3/index.html)
> predicting the future as accurately as possible, given all of the information available, including historical data and knowledge of any future events that might impact the forecasts.

The predictability of an event or a quantity depends on several factors including:
- how well we understand the factors that contribute to it
- how much data is available
- how similar the future is to the past
- whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast.

**Short-term forecasts:** are needed for the scheduling of personnel, production and transportation. As part of the scheduling process, forecasts of demand are often also required.

**Medium-term forecasts:** are needed to determine future resource requirements, in order to purchase raw materials, hire personnel, or buy machinery and equipment.

**Long-term forecasts:** are used in strategic planning. Such decisions must take account of market opportunities, environmental factors and internal resources.

**USE CASES**
- Scheduling
- Strategic Planning

**_BASIC STEPS_**
1. **Problem Definition:** understanding of the way the forecasts will be used, who requires the forecasts, and how the forecasting function fits within the organisation requiring the forecasts.
2. **Gathering Information:** (a) statistical data, and (b) the accumulated expertise of the people who collect the data and use the forecasts.
3. **EDA:** Are there consistent patterns? Is there a significant trend? Is seasonality important? Is there evidence of the presence of business cycles? Are there any outliers in the data that need to be explained by those with expert knowledge? How strong are the relationships among the variables available for analysis?
4. **Choosing & Fitting Models:**  best model to use depends on the availability of historical data, the strength of relationships between the forecast variable and any explanatory variables, and the way in which the forecasts are to be used.
5. **Using & Evaluating a Forecasting Model:**

**_TIME SERIES PATTERNS_**
- **Trend:** A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. It does not have to be linear.
- **Seasonal:** time series is affected by seasonal factors such as the time of the year or the day of the week. Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period.
- **Cyclic:** data exhibit rises and falls that are not of a fixed frequency. _These fluctuations are usually due to economic conditions, and are often related to the “business cycle.”_
